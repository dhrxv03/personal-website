## Overview

Developed a machine learning project to detect and analyze Lumpy Skin Disease in cattle, leveraging both image and behavioral datasets to provide a comprehensive and practical solution for early diagnosis and prevention.

## Key Features

- **Dual Dataset Integration**: Combined an image dataset obtained from Kaggle with a behavior dataset collected through interviews with real farmers, ensuring a holistic approach to disease detection.  
- **Deep Learning with DenseNet**: Utilized DenseNet architecture to analyze the image dataset and accurately identify visual symptoms of Lumpy Skin Disease.  
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Incorporated insights from farmers to develop predictive models based on behavioral changes in cattle, complementing the image-based diagnosis.  
- **Practical Focus**: Designed the system to address real-world challenges faced by farmers, making it accessible and actionable in agricultural settings.  
- **Model Optimization**: Fine-tuned the DenseNet model and optimized hyperparameters to achieve high accuracy and reduce false positives.  

## Technologies Used

- **DenseNet**: For deep learning-based image classification and symptom detection.  
- **Python**: Leveraged libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch for model training and implementation.  
- **Kaggle**: Source of the image dataset for training and validation.  
- **Survey Data**: Behavioral dataset gathered directly from farmers to enhance the model's contextual understanding.  

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Dataset Imbalance**: Addressed challenges in balancing the dataset to avoid model bias and improve accuracy for underrepresented cases.  
- **Farmer Collaboration**: Learned to effectively translate qualitative data from farmers into quantifiable features for model training.  
- **Model Efficiency**: Optimized the DenseNet model to ensure it could run efficiently on limited resources.  

## Outcome

The project successfully integrated image and behavioral data to provide an innovative and practical solution for diagnosing Lumpy Skin Disease. It highlights expertise in deep learning, data collection, and addressing real-world agricultural problems.
