- **Gamified User Flow**: Created a narrative-like structure where users explore projects and achievements as levels in a game, emphasizing the playful aspect of the portfolio.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Developed comprehensive documentation with Storybook to showcase components, usage patterns, and best practices, ensuring the design system is easy to adopt by other teams.

## Technologies Used
